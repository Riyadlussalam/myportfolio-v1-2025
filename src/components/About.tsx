          About Me
        </h2>

        <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          I am an Information Technology student with a strong focus on
          leadership, organizational management, and strategic execution.
          Currently, I serve as the President of BEM FILKOM UB 2026, leading
          cross-functional teams and initiatives that aim to create measurable
          impact for students and institutions.
        </p>

        <p className="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
          While my academic background is in technology, my core strength lies
          in bridging technical understanding with people, processes, and
          decision-making — ensuring ideas are not only designed, but executed
          effectively.
